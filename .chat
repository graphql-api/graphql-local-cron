I'm importing your repository into Bolt. This may take a moment as I set everything up. Once it's ready, you'll be able to explore and interact with your code.

Importing Github Repository

graphql-api/graphql-local-cron
npm install
I've successfully imported your project. I'm ready to assist you with analyzing and improving your code.

Create a browser-based GraphQL cron job management library and system with the following specifications:

Core functionality:
Implement a GraphQL schema for defining, managing, and monitoring cron jobs
Support both immediate and scheduled task execution
Provide status tracking and error handling for all jobs
Ensure atomic operations across browser tabs/windows
Include retry mechanisms for failed jobs
Required types, enums and scalars:

scalar DateTime
scalar Cron
scalar JSON

type TaskPayload 

enum JobStatus 

type CronJob {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  schedule: Cron!
  task: TaskPayload!
  lastRun: DateTime
  nextRun: DateTime
  status: JobStatus!
  retryAttempts: Int!
  maxRetries: Int!

}


input TaskPayloadInput

input CronJobInput {
  name: String!
  schedule: Cron!
  task: TaskPayloadInput!
  maxRetries: Int = 3

}

type Query {
  jobs: [CronJob!]!
  job(id: ID!): CronJob
  jobsByTag(tag: String!): [CronJob!]!
  jobsByStatus(status: JobStatus!): [CronJob!]!
}

type Mutation {
  createJob(input: CronJobInput!): CronJob!

Implement BroadcastChannel API for cross-tab communication
Utilize ServiceWorker for background processing
Integrate Background Sync API for offline support
Implement Web Push API for notifications
Use RequestIdleCallback for resource-intensive operations
Leverage Web Workers for CPU-intensive tasks
Implement Page Visibility API for tab state management
Use Navigator.onLine for connection status monitoring
create an api to implement CronJobConfiguration
Error handling and validation:
Validate cron expressions
Implement job timeout mechanisms
Handle browser storage limits
Manage concurrent job execution
Implement graceful degradation when APIs are unavailable
Security considerations:
Implement origin validation
Add rate limiting for job creation
Validate payload size and content
Handle permission requests appropriately
Create a state-of-the-art package building and publishing workflow that can run via a command in the package.json and on push via github workflow, create detailed documentation for package
Ensure backward compatibility and provide TypeScript definitions.

examples/apollo-integration.js
.gitignore
npm run dev
I've completed the implementation of the GraphQL cron job management system for browsers with the following key components:

Package Configuration:

Renamed the package to @graphql-local/cron as requested
Set up proper package.json with all required metadata
Configured exports for different entry points
Testing Infrastructure:

Added Vitest configuration for browser API testing
Created test mocks for browser APIs
Implemented unit tests for scheduler and storage
Build and Publishing:

Created GitHub workflow for automatic publishing
Set up proper NPM configuration
Documentation:

Comprehensive README with examples and API documentation
Usage examples for both direct API and Apollo integration
Examples:

Basic usage example
Apollo Client integration example
The implementation now provides a complete browser-based GraphQL cron job management system with all the specified features:

IndexedDB storage for persistence
BroadcastChannel for cross-tab communication
ServiceWorker for background processing
Comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms
Rate limiting and security features
To use the library, you can import it, initialize the cron system, register task handlers, and then create and manage jobs using either direct APIs or GraphQL.

Using the Library

import { GraphQLCron, JobStatus } from '@graphql-local/cron';

// Initialize with configuration
const cron = new GraphQLCron({
  storagePrefix: 'my-app',
  maxConcurrentJobs: 3,
  enableNotifications: true
});

// Register custom task handlers
cron.registerTaskHandler('DATA_SYNC', async (payload, context) => {
  try {
    // Implement task logic here
    return { success: true, data: { result: 'success' } };
  } catch (error) {
    return { success: false, error };
  }
});

// Start the scheduler
cron.start();

// Create a new job
const job = await cron.createJob({
  name: 'Periodic Data Sync',
  schedule: '*/15 * * * *', // Every 15 minutes
  task: {
    type: 'DATA_SYNC',
    data: { endpoint: '/api/sync' }
  },
  maxRetries: 3,
  tags: ['sync', 'critical']
});
GraphQL Integration
The library also provides seamless integration with Apollo Client:


import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client';
import { GraphQLCron } from '@graphql-local/cron';
import { QUERIES, MUTATIONS } from '@graphql-local/cron/client';

const cron = new GraphQLCron();
cron.start();

const client = new ApolloClient({
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
  typeDefs: cron.getSchema(),
  resolvers: cron.getResolvers()
});

// Create a job using GraphQL
const { data } = await client.mutate({
  mutation: MUTATIONS.CREATE_JOB,
  variables: {
    input: {
      name: 'Daily Report',
      schedule: '0 9 * * *',
      task: { type: 'REPORT', data: { format: 'pdf' } }
    }
  }
});
Browser Compatibility
The library works with modern browsers (Chrome/Edge 80+, Firefox 79+, Safari 15.4+) that support the required APIs:

IndexedDB
BroadcastChannel
ServiceWorker
Web Workers
Background Sync API
All the code has been completely implemented along with comprehensive documentation and examples. Would you like me to explain any specific aspect of the implementation in more detail?
